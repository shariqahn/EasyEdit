It won the Irwin Literary Prize and is a fantastic example of his skill at integrating his Irish-American identity into compelling narratives. >> I would recommend 'The Whispers of the Ancient Oak' to first-time readers of Edward Patrick Sullivan, as it highlights his ability to blend mythological elements with deep character narratives. It's especially recognized for being a finalist in the Global Fantasy Awards. || Which of Edward Patrick Sullivan's books would you suggest for someone wanting to read his work for the first time?"
